# Video Game Sales Analysis 🎮📊


Welcome to the **Video Game Sales Analysis** project! This project explores global video game sales data to uncover trends, insights, and hidden patterns using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The analysis is presented in a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file).

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**
This project analyzes a dataset of video game sales to answer questions like:
- What are the top-selling video games of all time?
- Which genres are the most popular globally?
- How do sales trends vary across regions (North America, Europe, Japan)?
- Which publishers dominate the video game industry?

The analysis is presented through **interactive visualizations** and **data-driven insights**.

## 📂 **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is the **"Video Game Sales"** dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales). It contains information about video game sales across different regions, genres, platforms, and publishers.

## 🛠️ **Tools Used**
- **Python**: For data analysis and scripting.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and documentation.

## 📊 **What I Did**
Here’s a breakdown of the steps I followed in this project:

### 1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
- Explored the dataset to understand its structure, columns, and data types.
- Checked for missing values and cleaned the data.

### 2. **Data Cleaning**
- Dropped rows with missing values.
- Converted the `Year` column to integers for better analysis.
- Filtered the dataset to focus on recent years (2000 onwards).

### 3. **Data Analysis**
- Identified the **top-selling games of all time**.
- Analyzed the **most popular genres** globally.
- Explored **regional sales trends** (North America, Europe, Japan).
- Determined the **top publishers** by global sales.

### 4. **Data Visualization**
- Created bar charts, pie charts, and line plots to visualize the insights.
- Used Matplotlib to customize the visualizations (colors, labels, titles).

### 5. **Unique Insights**
- Analyzed the lifespan of gaming platforms (e.g., how long each console stayed relevant).
